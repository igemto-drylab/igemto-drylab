Drylab Progress 2020

TODO List:
 - Consider torch.cuda. I wrote my code to be run on a CPU, but it would be
   much more efficient to train on a GPU in the future. Luckily, I don't think
   the necessary changes are that large...hopefully (Alston)  
 - If necessary, consider using in-place operations to save memory (Alston).
 - Work out how to split the meltome dataset so that it provides a good training and 
   testing environment. Considering 3 partitions, train, validation, and test.
   Perhaps 80/10/10? or 60/20/20? or 60/30/10? (Ryan)
 - Develop a system of easy training of future classifiers (Ryan)
