Drylab Progress 2020

TODO List:
 - Work out how to split_dataset the meltome dataset so that it provides a good training and 
   testing environment. Considering 3 partitions, train, validation, and test.
   Perhaps 80/10/10? or 60/20/20? or 60/30/10? (Ryan)
 - Develop a system of easy training of future classifiers (Ryan)
